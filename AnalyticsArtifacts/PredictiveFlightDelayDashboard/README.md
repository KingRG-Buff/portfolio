# ‚úàÔ∏è Predictive Flight Delay Dashboard

Welcome to **Predictive Flight Delay Dashboard**, a data-driven project designed as proof of concept to monitor and predict flight delays. This initiative leverages Azure Machine Learning (ML) and Power BI to provide actionable insights for improving operational efficiency and enhancing customer satisfaction in the aviation industry.

---

## üïπÔ∏è **How to Use**
1. Historical flight data is collected and processed to predict delays for flights departing within the next hour.
2. The predictive model is trained using Azure ML, incorporating factors like:
   - Departure time
   - Carrier
   - Origin and destination
   - Historical delay patterns
3. Predictions are exported via Azure ML endpoints and integrated into Power BI for real-time visualizations.
4. The Power BI dashboard highlights key metrics, patterns, and root causes of flight delays to assist carriers in implementing operational improvements.
