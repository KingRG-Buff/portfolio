# üì¶ Mailroom Management Application

Welcome to the **Mailroom Management Application**, a software solution designed to streamline mail and package handling for the fictional BuffTeks apartment complex. The diagrams purpose is to develop an application which improves efficiency for leasing office staff, reduces unclaimed package clutter, and notifies residents when their packages are ready for pickup.

## üïπÔ∏è **How to Use**
1. **User Login**:
   - Leasing office staff logs in with a secure username and password.
2. **Package Delivery Process**:
   - Search for the resident's information within the application.
   - Select the correct resident and postal service agency (e.g., FedEx, USPS, UPS).
   - Confirm the information to add the package to the **Pending Area**.
   - Automatically send an email notification to the resident.
3. **Package Pickup Process**:
   - When the resident picks up their package, staff removes the record from the **Pending Area**.
4. **Unknown Packages**:
   - For packages addressed to non-residents, staff inputs the information into the **Unknown Area**.
   - The application tracks unknown packages for later return to the postal service.
5. **Package Record Retrieval**:
   - Retrieve a resident's package history by searching their name or unit number.
